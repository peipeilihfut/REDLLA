# REDLLA
classification algorithm for data streams with recurrent concept drifts


REDLLA algorithm is called SSEMUI here.
If you select KMeans, it is the REDLLA algorithm.  If you select the KMode as the parameter, it is our other algorith -SUN. 

We give the detailed description about the relevant parameter settings in "Parameter list and command of batch file.doc". But it is for our READLLA algorithm.
 You can select kmode by setting '-clusway 0' for SUN. Other parametes are similar. You can learn more from source codes. 
In source code, the main function main() is at the file of 'SRDTSystem.cpp'.

Our project is implemented in Visual Studio 2003 VC++ (Windows XP operation system).
